A* pathfinding

You will need to use the makefile to produce the exec file using make in the shell.

When you run it, you will have the obtion to have ostaclees or not.
If yes then you can change the density of block on the grid.

The you will need to give the start coordinate and the end coordinate.
If the coordinate are out of bound or are on unwalkable block, it will tell you so.
If the path between the coordinate doesn't exist because there is no way due to the block blocking the way, it will tell you.

But if the path exits, then will print the print with an emoji ascii moving on the path, the path is represented by satr emoji ascii.
